    <li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I was born in Grand Rapids, MI
        but was adopted and raised in Charlotte, NC</li>
    <li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I graduated from Myers Park
        HS mid-year (Jan 2022), was going to try Year Up at CPCC but had
        some issues so I started at CPCC in general in summer 2022 taking
        some general courses (like bio and psych) and started getting
        interested in computer science and my current major is computer
        programming (might be "full stack")</li>
    <li><strong>Professional background:</strong> a church friend who (I think)
        works with applied data tech hooked me up with one of his friends who
        works for the Dept of defense and takes one man helicopters and puts
        computers in them and turns them into robotic autonomous/unmanned
        helicopters (kind of like drones but instead of running off a controller
        they work off a computer program using ROS (robot operating system)) and
        he wants me to program a couple of the sensors for one of those helicopters
        (starting after this spring semester)</li>
    <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I started with CTI110 which got
        me into web dev and programming and I wanted to learn CSS so I took WEB110
        which also introduced JS which got me into WEB115 and a major in FSD</li>

            <li>CSC114 Artificial Intelligence - had to have another 'elective' class in order
                to have a full 12+ credit hour semester for sponsorship by the DSB (division of
                services for the blind/visually impaired) and one of these classes was only 2
