<h2>Course contract</h2>
<p>I, <a class="in-text-link content-link" href="#intro">Charles Scott</a>, agree to abide
    by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N850 Database Driven Websites
    course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen</p>
<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal
    websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not
    put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or
    that I wish to keep private.</p>
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance,
    not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in
    assignments may show as absences.</p>
<p>Signed: Charles Scott 1/20/2025</p>
